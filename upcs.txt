Only 34 (out of 7+ million) UPCs do *not* start with '978'.

= UPCs =

results table
 - each result: always a single lxm

the lexicon
 - all lxm are (roughly) same length
 - no lxm is a sub- or superstring of another
 - each lxm appears in only one result

matrix
 - each set of result_ids is of cardinality 1


however...

query results
 - always want only by-popularity sort
 - don't care about lexical rank
 - don't care about similarity sorting

query tree
 - always only a single node.  (no and/or/not.)
 - no need to store entire set of matches per lxm;
   store only 5 res_ids for each lxm!


alt version of dump_usages.ml
 - create multiple variants per UPC:
    978465452189
    97846
    9784
    978
    97
    9
 - the resultant file will be HUGE (~40M entries).

alt version of matrix_mkr.ml
 - no 'lexes_col' necessary.
 - but then also need alt matrix.ml

create alt version of usages_file_rdr.ml
 - write_gloss() should keep only the top X (five?) pop
 - use prio_queue.ml to implement.
